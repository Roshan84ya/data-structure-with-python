Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects.
Hashing is used to store and retrieve the data in the efficient way.

Some example is :- name in the attandance register such that each student is identified uniquely.

In the hashing we have an object and we wanted to store it such that we can search it easily so we assign
a key to that value i.e (key: value pair) for small key we can directly make or use the index as the key
but when we have large values of the keys so we can't use them directly as the index so here we have
solution for it that is hashing.

****** In hashing large keys are conveted into the small keys by using hash function.
	and the values are stored in the data structure called hash table ****
the main idea behind it is to access the values in the o(1) time.

###
	HAshing is implemented in the two ways
	i)	the element is converted into integer by using hash function .So that the element
		can be used as index to store the original element that is stored in the hash table.
	ii)	the element is stored in the hash table where it can be quicly retrive using the hash
		key.
		hash=hashfunc(key)
		index=hash%array_size

****NOTE:- In this the hash is independent of the size of the table and is converted into (0 -- arraysize-1)

Hash function:-
	A hash function is any function that is used to map the data set of an arbitrary size to the
	data set of the fixed size, which falls into hash table.The vlues return by the hash function
	is termed as hash value ,hash code hash sum.

** To achieve the good hashing mechanism it is important to have a good hash fucntion with the given
   qualities or requirements.
	1) It should be easy to calculate
	2) Do not produce clustering i.e should be result in the uniform distribution
	3) Less collision


**************** COllision resolution technique *****************
i)Saperate chaining (Open hashing)
	It is most commonly used collision resolution technique, and it uses linked list to store the
item, i.e each item is stored in the linked list and if any collision will occur then a seperate
chain is startes in that branch.

****NOTE******
in wrost case the all the element may fall in the same linked list branch and again it will take O(N) time to 
search the element.


ii) Linear probing
	In open addressing, instead of the linked list we use array directly and after calculating
the hash value we put that record at the index that is equal to the hash value and iff the place is
unoccupied and if the place will occupied then the we search the next index till we found a blank index
by teaversing each time +1 position.

i.e

index=index%hashtablesize
index=(index+1)%hashtablesize "" till we find all the element

to find the element we have to search that index or the unoccupied index.
